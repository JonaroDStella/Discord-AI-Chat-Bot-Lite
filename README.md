# Discord-AI-Chat-Bot-Lite

Just found my chat bot too complicated.
So I made this, the actual first version of my chat bot, with some improvements.
## Preparation
1. you need an OpenAI API key
2. Change the settings in ```config.py```.
3. Download the [VOICEVOX](https://voicevox.hiroshiba.jp/) API.
4. Keep ```run.exe``` running.
## How To Use
- Basic Chatting
  1. Type your message after ```chat_prefix```. For the default setting, try ```> hi```.
- Make it speak
  1. Use ```join``` and ```leave``` command. ```$ join```, for example.
  2. Chat with the AI and wait for the response.
